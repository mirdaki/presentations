## Style

- Subject matter
- Color, texture, layout
- Theme
	- "To share the hidden beauty of the everyday world" <!-- .element: style="color: #E74727;" -->

Note:
- How to make your photography yours



## Fundamentals <!-- .element: style="color: #E74727;" -->

- Focus
- Composition
- Exposure



## Focus

<blockquote>
	"The distinctness or clarity of an image rendered by an optical system."
	<hr>
	<cite>thefreedictionary.com</cite>
</blockquote>


## Focus

<blockquote>
	"A center of interest or activity."
	<hr>
	<cite>thefreedictionary.com</cite>
</blockquote>


## Focus

	<img src="images/focus.jpg" alt="Dragonfly on grass"></img>
</p>

Note:
- Ref: https://photographylife.com/understanding-focus-in-photography


## Manual Focus

- More control, but slow
- Auto focus can fail
	- Reflective or small items
- Good practice


## Auto Focus

- Practical and fast
- Continuous vs Single
- Area Modes

Note:
- Continuous is great for moving targets, but need to practice with it
- Different modes for the size of subject


## Practice <!-- .element: style="color: #E74727;" -->

## Exposure

<blockquote>
	"The amount of light per unit area"
	<hr>
	<cite>thefreedictionary.com</cite>
</blockquote>


## Exposure

<blockquote>
	"Determines the brightness or darkness of an image, and more"
	<hr>
	<cite>wikipedia.com</cite>
</blockquote>


## The Triangle

- Three balancing components
	- Aperture
	- Shutter Speed
	- ISO
- Manual vs Priority mode

Note:
- Manual gives you full control
- Priority lets you control one components and it auto does the others


## Aperture

- The size of the opening in a lens
- f/32 is small, f/2 is large
- Affects depths of field

Note:
- Measured in f-stops, size of opening / actual size
- We will discuss depth of field more later, but smaller aperture will produce small depth of field


## Aperture

<p style="display: flex; justify-content: center; height: 60%;">
	<img src="images/aperture.jpg" alt="Various apeature sizes"></img>
</p>

Note:
Ref: https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F8T94sdiNjc/maxresdefault.jpg


## Shutter Speed

- Amount of time the senor is exposed
- 1/300s vs 5 minute
- Longer = more light
- Keep in mind subject

Note:
- Measured in fractions of a second to minutes
- Tripod helps to increase length of time, because hands shake to much, even when propped


## Shutter Speed

<p style="display: flex; justify-content: center; height: 60%;">

Note:
- Ref: https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nCTwM2AKTb4/T_tEO1NRXtI/AAAAAAAAAiM/JH0ak56vQjM/s1600/ShutterSpeed+pic.JPG


## ISO

- Camera's sensitivity to light
- Artificially brightness an image
- More is brighter but causes "noise"


## ISO

<p style="display: flex; justify-content: center; height: 60%;">
	<img src="images/iso.jpg" alt="ISO comparison"></img>

## Other Basics <!-- .element: style="color: #E74727;" -->

- Sharpness
- Depth of Field
- Lighting
- White Balance
- Focal Length
- Field of View



## Sharpness

- The clarity of detail in the image
- Affected by
	- Color contrast
	- Light
	- Depth of field


## Sharpness

<p style="display: flex; justify-content: center; height: 80%;">
	<img src="images/sharpness.jpg" alt="Sharpness comparison"></img>
</p>

Note:
- Ref: https://improvephotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/sharpness-eyes-example.jpg



## Depth of Field

- Distance between the closest and farthest sharp points
- Wider aperture = smaller
- Closer = smaller


## Depth of Field

<p style="display: flex; justify-content: center; height: 50%;">
	<img src="images/depth-of-field.jpg" alt="Depth of field diagram"></img>
</p>

Note:
- Ref: https://photographylife.com/what-is-depth-of-field



## Lighting

- Electromagnetic radiation?
- More than just how much

Note:
- Wasn't sure how to describe it, hope everyone understands this


## Position

<p style="display: flex; justify-content: center; height: 35%;">
	<img src="images/position.jpg" alt="Wedding couple in dooorway"></img>
</p>

Note:
- Behind, above, in front, to the side, all affect the feeling
- Ref: https://www.creativelive.com/photography-guides/lighting-for-beginners


## Hard

<p style="display: flex; justify-content: center; height: 60%;">
	<img src="images/hard.jpg" alt="Couple in grassy field"></img>
</p>

Note:
- Hard causes noticeable shadows and back lighting
- Ref: https://www.creativelive.com/photography-guides/lighting-for-beginners


## Soft

<p style="display: flex; justify-content: center; height: 70%;">
	<img src="images/soft.jpg" alt="Headhsot of girl looking at camera"></img>
</p>

Note:
- Soft is lack of shadow, smoother quality
- Ref: https://pbblogassets.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2015/08/Soft-Lighting-Outside-Example.jpg


## Color

<p style="display: flex; justify-content: center; height: 65%;">
	<img src="images/color.jpg" alt="Comparison of colored lights"></img>
</p>

Note:
- Measured in kelvin
- Ref: https://www.creativelive.com/photography-guides/lighting-for-beginners


## Options

- Time of day
- Weather
- Indoor vs outdoor
- Do it yourself



## White Balance

- The shade of white influenced by lighting
- Warmer = reds and yellows
- Cooler = blues and purples
- Use white card or camera presets

Note:
- Can change white balance to adjust in-camera style
- Usually want a proper white for easier editing


## White Balance

<p style="display: flex; justify-content: center; height: 65%;">

</p>

Note:
- Ref: https://www.louisdallaraphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/white-balance.jpg



## Focal Length

- Magnification of an image
- More length = more magnification
- 50mm is considered true

Note:
- Property of a lens
- Measured in mm
- True means like our eyes see


## Focal Length

<p style="display: flex; justify-content: center; height: 75%;">
	<img src="images/focal-length.png" alt="Focal length diagram"></img>
</p>

Note:

</p>

Note:
- Ref: https://www.colesclassroom.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/1_GRID-Focal-Length-1_BLOG_final.jpg



## Field of View

- How wide an angle an image is
- More length = more narrow

Note:
- Property of a lens
- Related to focal length


## Field of View

<p style="display: flex; justify-content: center; height: 80%;">

## Cameras and Lenses <!-- .element: style="color: #E74727;" -->

- Lens types
- DSLR vs Mirrorless
- Crop vs Full Frame
- Smartphone
- Other



## Lens types

- Lots of factors
- No "right" lens

Note:
- But there are often more suited lenses


## Length

- Focal length
- Field of view

Note:
- Like we just discussed


## Prime vs Variable

- Prime
	- "Faster", sharper, smaller, cheaper
- Variable
	- Versatile, need less lenses
- Not definitive

Note:
- Faster refers to bigger aperture, because you can take in more light in less time
- There are nice variable lenses that outperform primes
- There are specialized primes that are more expensive and heaver


## Holy trinity

- 16-35mm
- 24-70mm
- 70-200mm

Note:
- The idea is this covers all normal basis, but your needs will vary


## Mount type

- Physical connection to camera
	- Also electronic communication
- Manufactures can have multiple types
- Adapters to mix and match

Note:
- Electronics are used for things like auto focus and object tracking
- Each camera manufacture has at least one type of mount


## Other

- Stabilization
- Size/weight
- Full vs crop
- Specialization

Note:
- Stabilization accounts for hand movement, may create noise
- Specialization like super telephoto or macro for product or insect photography



## DSLR vs Mirrorless

- Two styles of cameras
- Different technologies
- Similar use


## DSLR

- Mirror that physically moves light to viewfinder
- Viewfinder is real time
- Older, cheaper, better battery, more lenses

Note:
- Digital Single Lens Reflex Cameras
- Viewfinder has no electronic delay
- Less electronics mean less power draw
- More lenses because those mounts have been around longer


## Mirrorless

- No mirror, viewfinder is screen
- Viewfinder shows what will be captured
- Newer tech, smaller/lighter

Note:
- Can not overstate how useful it is to see what the actual exposure being captured is
- Lenses can also be smaller to match the form factor, off load electronics
- My suggestion is to start with an entry level DSLR, because of costs, but get lenses that could work for mirrorless
- Also, need more sensor cleaning (which must be delicate), because no extra protection from mirror



## Full Frame vs Crop

- Size of the sensor
- Lenses support

Note:
- Depending on the mount, you might not be able to use a crop lens on a full frame camera or vice versa


## Full Frame

- Same as old 35mm film, industry standard
- Focal lengths are "true"
- Higher resolution, more light

Note:
- True refers to the old industry standard
- Full frame usually has nicer and more expensive options, for "professional" use


## Crop

- Smaller than full, no standard
- Increase the magnification relative to full
- Cheaper, smaller cameras

Note:
- Each manufacture usually standardizes a crop ratio, like 1.5x (full frame)


## Smartphone

- "The best camera is the one you have with you"
- Pro mode
- Some control of exposure
- RAW format

Note:
- Smartphones also use a lot of image processing


## Other

- Lighting or mic accessories
- Type of SD card
- Size of battery
- Customization
- Software experience

Note:
- Manufacture have lots of varying accessories to consider
- Nicer cameras might require more expensive SD cards
- Customization refers to how much you can tweak cameras settings to better control it



## Other Aspects <!-- .element: style="color: #E74727;" -->

- RAW vs JPEG
- Editing
- Organizing
- Sharing



## RAW vs JPEG

- RAW is a series of formats
	- Collect more data for editing
- JPEG are smaller, easier to share

Note:
- Setting in camera, RAW is preferred if you want to edit
- Size of photos makes a huge difference in storage size



## Editing

- Improve images or more artsy
- Lots of software
	- [Darktable](https://www.darktable.org/)
	- [Lightroom](https://lightroom.adobe.com/)


## Change

- Brightness
- Color
- Contrast
- Noise
- Aspect ratio

Note:
- More than this, but this is the core


## In Camera

- Don't rely on editing
- Filters
- Gels

Note:
- While learning, try getting it right in camera first
- Editing takes a while to get used to too
- Filters can polarize, protect, graduated density
- Gels colorize



## Organizing

- Folder hierarchy by date
- Software to tag and organize photos
	- [digiKam](https://www.digikam.org/)
	- [Lightroom](https://lightroom.adobe.com/)

Note:
- There are many techniques, these are just my suggestions
- Tag by location or style
- Some can recognize people too



## Sharing

- Sites have rights to your content
- Watermarks and metadata
- Alt text

Note:
- Each site is different, but generally can always hold on to it, but can advertise too
- Metadata can be stripped
- Accessibility to describe the image



## Next Steps <!-- .element: style="color: #E74727;" -->

- Make a commitment
- Grow skills



## Make a commitment

- Use your phone
- Take photos with intent
- Rent cameras and lenses

Note:
- Use your phone



## Grow skills

- Find photographers you like
- Submit work to art shows or contest
- Join groups for comments and critiques

Note:
- Learn from the style of a photographer
