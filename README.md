# Presentations

This repository contains a collection of web presentations I've used in the hopes people will find them useful and suggest improvements!

The presentations uses [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js) with my theme [revealjs-swiss](https://github.com/mirdaki/revealjs-swiss).

## Usage

Install node and npm. Then download live-server:

```bash
npm install --development
```

To use the presentation locally, run the below command and go to [127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080/):

```bash
npm start
```
