# Presentations

This repository contains a collection of web presentations I've used in the hopes people will find them useful and suggest improvements!

The presentations uses [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js) via [revealer](https://github.com/cdaringe/revealer) to package it as a dependency with the [revealjs-swiss](https://github.com/mirdaki/revealjs-swiss) theme I developed.

## Usage

Install node and npm. Then download revealer with:

```bash
npm install --development
```

To use the presentation locally, run the below command and go to [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/):

```bash
npm start
```

<!-- To create a fully independent static website, use the below command (and change then directory path):

```bash
npm build <destination-directory>
``` -->
